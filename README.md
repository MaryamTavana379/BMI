Features
Easy-to-use: The BMI Calculator provides a straightforward interface for users to input their height and weight.
BMI Calculation: The calculator uses the formula BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2 to calculate the BMI value.
Metric and Imperial Units: The calculator supports both metric (kilograms and meters) and imperial (pounds and inches) units, giving users the flexibility to input their measurements in their preferred system.
BMI Categories: The tool categorizes BMI results into different ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese, providing a clear interpretation of the BMI value.
Real-time Results: The BMI calculation is performed instantly, and the BMI category is displayed immediately after the user submits their data.
